-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.) Description

	pMissionMonitor monitors one or more logical conditions imposed on 
	specified variables in the MOOS database.  If any of these conditions
	evaluates to FALSE, a corresponding set of variables and values is 
	published to the MOOS database.  All logical conditions are evaluated any 
	time mail is received from the MOOS database, and also in the application's 
	Iterate() method.  Thus, conditions are continuously enforced at a rate 
	determined by the value of the APP_TICK mission file parameter.
	
	  



-------------------------------------------------------------
2.) Usage Info

USAGE:   pMissionMonitor MISSION_FILE

MISSION_FILE
        A MOOS mission file containing configuration parameters for the
        pMissionMonitor application




-------------------------------------------------------------
3.) MOOS VARIABLES PUBLISHED BY pMissionMonitor

	Variable:		        Description:
	------------	        -------------------------------------------------------
	PMISSIONMONITOR_CMD		Used to issue a command to pMissionMonitor.  See 
					        Section 4 - Application Commands for details

	Additional variables published to are set from the contents of a Monitor 
	configuration file loaded at startup.  See section
	 



-------------------------------------------------------------
4.) APPLICATION COMMANDS

The following command strings may be published to the MOOS variable PMMon_CMD
in order to issue simple commands to the application:

 
 
 

-------------------------------------------------------------
5.) MOOS VARIABLES SUBSCRIBED TO BY pMissionMonitor

	Variable: pMM_ResetMonitor
	Value:
		Post a value of TRUE to this variable to reset the Critical Stop
		condition.  Bear in mind that if the fault condition still exists,
		pMissionMonitor will simply detect the fault and re-enforce the
		Critical Stop again.

	
-------------------------------------------------------------
6.) Monitor configuration (.mcf) file syntax

	Monitor configuration (.mcf) files shall consist of ASCII text specifying  
	one or more variables and logical conditions to monitor.  Each block shall
	be composed of a matching set of brace characters ("{" and "}") between
	which are found fields describing a logical condition in the MOOS database  
	be monitored. 
	
	{
		NAME		= <string>
		
		CONDITION	= <logic expression>
		  ...
		CONDITION	= <logic expression>
		
		PUBLISH		= <MOOS variable name> = <string or double value>
		  ...
		PUBLISH		= <MOOS variable name> = <string or double value>
		
		PRINT		= <string>
	}
 
	NAME 
		A name or short description to associate with the configuration block
	 
	CONDITION 
		One or more of these fields may be used to specify a logical condition
		that is to be monitored.  A string containing one or more logical 
		expressions involving MOOS variables to be monitored.  If any of these
		logical conditions evaluate to FALSE, the corresponding PUBLISH 
		directives given in the configuration block will be carried out, and 
		values will be published to the MOOS database.  
		
		Logical expressions are the same as those used in the run conditions of 
		pHelmIvP behaviors.  The left-hand side of an expression is assumed to 
		be the name of a MOOS variable, while the right-hand side is a literal 
		value.
		
	PUBLISH
		One or more lines each specifying a MOOS variable and value to publish 
		if any CONDITIONS given in the block evaluate to FALSE.

	PRINT
		An optional parameter that specifies a string to be printed to stdio
		if CONDITION evaluates to FALSE 




-------------------------------------------------------------
7.) Mission File Parameters

=======================
REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
=======================

	Parameter				Description
	-----------------		---------------------------------------------------
	MONITOR_CONFIG_FILE		A string value holding the absolute path of a file 
							from which variables and conditions to be monitored
							should be loaded.



-------------------------------------------------------------
8.) BUILD DEPENDENCIES
	
	pMissionManager depends on the following MOOS and IvP libraries:
		- MOOS
		- MOOSGen
		- logic (IVP)
		- mbutil (IVP)
