	the MOOS community via a BunnySock network connection

        iScotty application




		 
-------------------------------------------------------------
3.) MOOS VARIABLES PUBLISHED BY iScotty

Variable:				Description:
-----------------		-------------------------------------------------------
PROPELLER_RPM			Measured propeller RPM on the Scotty module

RPM_VELOCITY_ESTIMATE	Estimated vehicle velocity based on current propeller 
						RPM

SCOTTY_SERVO_CENTERS	A string indicating the value of trim values applied to 
						actuator commands sent to the Scotty module.  This  
						report is published once when the application connects 
						to the MOOSDB.  The format of this string is:

			"Rudder=[INT], ElevL=[INT], ElevR=[INT], CouplingCoeff=[DOUBLE]"




-------------------------------------------------------------
4.) MOOS VARIABLES SUBSCRIBED TO BY iScotty

Variable:			Description:
-----------------	----------------------------------------------------------
NAV_YAW			    The current vehicle yaw in radians
NAV_SPEED			The current vehicle speed in meters/sec
NAV_DEPTH			The current vehicle depth in meters
NAV_PITCH			The current vehicle pitch in radians
NAV_ROLL			The current vehicle roll in radians


DESIRED_HEADING		Desired vehicle heading in degrees as published by pHelmIvP
DESIRED_SPEED		Desired vehicle speed in meters/sec published by pHelmIvP
DESIRED_DEPTH		Desired vehicle depth in meters published by pHelmIvP
DESIRED_PITCH		Desired vehicle pitch in radians (currently unused, but
					included for future enhancements)
DESIRED_ROLL		Desired vehicle roll in radians published by pHelmIvP


DESIRED_RUDDER		Desired rudder angle in radians (0..+/- Pi).  Each time
					a value is published to this variable, an actuator command 
					will be sent to the Scotty module.  A value of 0.0 will
					center the rudder in its null position.  Positive values 
					result in negative vehicle yaw (positive heading) and a
					change in direction toward starboard.

DESIRED_ELEVATOR	Desired elevator angle in radians (0..+/- Pi).  Each time
					a value is published to this variable, an actuator command 
					will be sent to the Scotty module.  A value of 0.0 will 
					center the elevator actuators in their null position.
					Positive values result in a negative vehicle pitch (i.e. 
		    		they will cause the vehicle to dive deeper).

DESIRED_AILERON		Desired elevator aileron setting in radians (0..+/- Pi).  
					Each time a value is published to this variable, an 
					actuator command will be sent to the Scotty module.  A 
					value of 0.0 results in zero aileron (i.e. pure elevator)
					actuator operation.  Positive values will result in a 
					positive change in vehicle roll.  Negative values will 
					result in a negative change in vehicle roll. 

DESIRED_THRUST		Desired propeller thrust as a percentage of full scale 
					(0..+/-100).  Each time a value is published to this 
					variable, an actuator command will be sent to the Scotty 
					module.  Positive values result in forward (bow-ward) 
					vehicle motion.  Negative values drive the propeller in 
					reverse, resulting in aft-ward vehicle motion.


MOOS_MANUAL_OVERIDE	Used to enable/disable and initialize PID controllers that
					regulate vehicle heading, speed, depth, and roll.  When
					MOOS_MANUAL_OVERIDE has the value "TRUE", the controllers 
					are reset and do not issue any actuator commands to the 
					Scotty module.  When MOOS_MANUAL_OVERIDE has the value 
					"FALSE", the controllers are enabled, and produce no 
					actuator commands.  NOTE: Actuator commands are always 
					issued whenever values are published to	DESIRED_YAW, 
					DESIRED_SPEED, DESIRED_DEPTH, or DESIRED_ROLL.  


iScotty_MAX_DEPTH	The maximum depth in meters allowed by the PID depth 
					controller in iScotty.  This is used to saturate values 
					received in DESIRED_DEPTH.  The default maximum depth
					setting applied when iScotty starts is 20.0 meters.


YAW_PID_Kp			Proportional gain used in the yaw PID controller
YAW_PID_Ki			Integral gain used in the yaw PID controller
YAW_PID_Kd			Derivative gain used in the yaw PID controller
YAW_PID_IntSat		Integral saturation value for the yaw PID controller

ROLL_PID_Kd			Derivative gain used in the roll PID controller
ROLL_PID_IntSat		Integral saturation value for the roll PID controller
ROLL_PID_OutSat		Output saturation value for the roll PID controller

					pitch controller
PITCH_PID_KpDepth	Proportional gain applied to depth law input to the 
					pitch controller
PITCH_PID_Ki		Integral gain used in the pitch controller
PITCH_PID_Kd		Derivative gain used in the pitch controller
PITCH_PID_IntSat	Integral saturation value for the pitch controller
PITCH_PID_OutSat	Output saturation value for the pitch controller

SCOTTY_SERVO_TRIMS	A string specifying trim values to be sent to SCOTTY in
					the form: "EL=<int>,ER=<int>,R=<int>,CC=<real>"
					Where <int> and <float> indicate the value to use
					for the servo setting and
						EL = Left elevator servo center (1..255)
						ER = Right elevator servo center (1..255)
						RR = Rudder servo center (1..255)
						CC = Servo coupling coefficient (0.0...1.0)
						
						

ISCOTTY_CMD		This variable may be used to issue one of the following command
				strings to control iScotty behavior:
				
				"YawControlIsEnabled=[TRUE/FALSE]"
					Enables/disables the Yaw PID controller
					
				"SpeedControlIsEnabled=[TRUE/FALSE]"
					Enables/disables the Speed PID controller
				
				"DepthControlIsEnabled=[TRUE/FALSE]"
					Enables/disables the Depth PID controller
				
				"RollControlIsEnabled=[TRUE/FALSE]"
					Enables/disables the Roll PID controller
					
				"PitchControlIsEnabled=[TRUE/FALSE]"

				"ResetPIDs"		Resets all PID controllers
				"DisableProp"	Disables all thrust sent to SCOTTY (mainly for
								benchtop or walk-in-the-park testing) 
				"EnableProp"	Enables thrust commands sent to SCOTTY (mainly for
								benchtop or walk-in-the-park testing)
