-------------------------------------------------------------
1.) Description

	This application may be used to direct the timing of activity on the 
	acoustic communications network and navigation pings.  


-------------------------------------------------------------
2.) Usage Info

USAGE:   pAcousticCommsAgent MISSION_FILE

MISSION_FILE
        A MOOS mission file containing configuration parameters for the
        pAcousticCommsAgent application



-------------------------------------------------------------
3.) MOOS VARIABLES PUBLISHED BY pAcousticCommsAgent

	Variable:				Description:
	----------------		----------------------------------------
	ACTIVE_COMMS_TIMESLICE	A string containing the NAME field of the currently 
							active time slice in the communications cycle.



-------------------------------------------------------------
4.) MOOS VARIABLES SUBSCRIBED TO BY pAcousticCommsAgent



-------------------------------------------------------------
5.) MISSION FILE PARAMETERS
	
	Parameter:				Description:
	----------------		----------------------------------------
	TIMING_CYCLE_FILE		A string containing the full path of a
							.tdm file from which a timing cycle 
							configuration will be loaded.



-------------------------------------------------------------
6.) TIMING CYCLE (.cyc) FILE SYNTAX

	Timing cycle (.tdm) files shall consist of ASCII text specifying one or 
	more time slice blocks.  These blocks shall have the following form and
	fields:
	
	{
		NAME		= <string>
		ORDER		= <integer>
		DURATION	= <double>
		CONDITION	= <logic expression>
		
		PUBLISH	= <MOOS variable name> = <string or double value>
		  ...
		PUBLISH		= <MOOS variable name> = <string or double value>
		
		ALWAYSPUBLISH	= <MOOS variable name> = <string or double value>  
	}
 
	NAME: A name or short description to associate with the time slice.
	 
	ORDER: A positive integer value used to order this slice among other time
		   slice blocks.  Slices with the lowest ORDER value occur earlier than
		   slices with higher ORDER values within the timing cycle.
		    
	DURATION: The duration of the time slice (i.e. the length of time it will
			  be active) in seconds.
			  
	CONDITION: A string containing one or more logical expressions used to  
			   enable the time slice's PUBLISH activities.  Logical expressions
			   are the same as those used in the run conditions of pHelmIvP 
			   behaviors.  The left-hand side of an expression is assumed to 
			   be the name of a MOOS variable, while the right-hand side is a
			   literal value.  If the specified CONDITION expression evaluates
			   to TRUE, all of the time slice's PUBLISH activities will be 
			   carried out when the slice becomes active.  If the condition 
			   evaluates to FALSE, only PUBLISH activities specified with the 
			   "@ALWAYS" flag will be carried out.  The string "TRUE" may be
			   substituted for a logical expression, in which case, the slice's 
			   PUBLISH activities will be carried out anytime the slice is
			   active.
		
	PUBLISH: One or more lines specifying a MOOS variable and value to publish
			 if the time slice becomes active and its CONDITION is satisfied.

 	ALWAYSPUBLISH: One or more lines specifying a MOOS variable and value that 
 			 	   will be published whenever the time slice becomes active 
 			 	   regardless of whether its CONDITION is satisfied.

7.) BUILD DEPENDENCIES
