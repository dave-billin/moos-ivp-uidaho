# DESCRIPTION: 
#   Information and build instructions for the moos-ivp-uidaho source tree
##=============================================================================

#===========================
# Introduction
#===========================
    The moos-ivp-uidaho source tree contains applications and libraries 
developed at the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho.  The majority of these 
modules have been developed solely for use on native (x86/x86_64) Linux or 
Gumstix (TI OMAP3 running Angstrom Linux) target platforms, and do not build
under Windows.


#===========================
# Directory Structure
#===========================
The structure of the moos-ivp-uidaho source tree is decribed below:
--------------
DIRECTORIES:
--------------
arch                  - Directory where static libraries are placed
bin                   - Directory where executable files are placed
build                 - Directory containing build object files
data                  - Directory for storing data and resources common to all
                        moos-ivp-uidaho applications.
src                   - Directory containing source code for all modules

docs                  - Top-level documentation directory.  This will typically
                        contain:
                            - man   Generated UNIX man-files for applications
                            - html  Doxygen-generated source code documentation

lib                   - Directory where shared libraries are placed

--------------
FILES:
--------------
build.sh              - Script to configure, build, and clean the source tree
                        Run with '--help' for details

build-clean.sh        - Script to clean and re-build the moos-ivp-uidaho tree
build-gumstix.sh      - Script to configure and build the source tree for a
                        Gumstix CPU target.

#===========================
# Build Instructions
#===========================

NOTE: This project depends on libraries provided by the MOOS and the MOOS-IvP
source trees.  It is assumed that these libraries have already been built or
installed on the local machine.  If building against a moos-ivp source tree,
the moos-ivp-uidaho source tree or trunk may be checked out directly into the \
"moos-ivp" source folder, or into the same directory that contains the 
"moos-ivp" folder.  If the "moos-ivp" folder must reside in some other path,
the location may be entered into the CMake variable MOOS_IVP_SOURCE_TREE_BASE
via one of the CMake GUI's.


#-----------------------
# Linux and Mac Users
#-----------------------

To build on Linux and Apple platforms, run the build script provided in the
top-level directory of the moos-ivp-uidaho source tree:

   #> ./build.sh


#----------------------------------------
# Building for Gumstix (TI OMAP3) CPU
#----------------------------------------
To build for the Gumstix, you must first install the appropriate cross-compiler 
toolchain.  This can be done using the following steps:
    1.) Set up the OpenEmbedded build system on your computer.  Instructions on
        how to do this can be found on the www.Gumstix.org website: 
        http://gumstix.org/software-development/open-embedded/61-using-the-open
        -embedded-build-system.html

    2.) Type 'bitbake meta-toolchain' at the command line.  This will build the
        cross-compiler toolchain for your (native) OS and processor and place
        it in a tar file in ${OVEROTOP}/tmp/deploy/glibc/sdk

    3.) Copy the toolchain tar file (typically called something like
        "angstrom-<vvv>.X-test-<ggg>-armv7a-linux-gnueabi-toolchain.tar.bz2")
        to your file system root and extract it using the following 
        commands:

            sudo cp ${OVEROTOP}/tmp/deploy/glibc/sdk/angstrom-<vvv>.X-test- ...
                   <ggg>-armv7a-linux-gnueabi-toolchain.tar.bz2
            cd /
            
            tar -xjvpf angstrom-<vvv>.X-test-<ggg>-armv7a-linux-gnueabi- ...
                   toolchain.tar.bz2

    4.) Run the provided script used to build for the gumstix:
        #> ./build-gumstix.sh

NOTE: If you are manually configuring CMake, a CMake toolchain file for Gumstix
      builds can be found in ./build/toolchain-gumstix-omap3.cmake



#-----------------------
# Windows Users
#-----------------------
Software in the moos-ivp-uidaho source tree has been primarily designed for a
UNIX-like (Linux or MacOS) target.  Consequently, builds for the Windows OS
are currently disabled.  Support for a Windows target may be included in future
releases of the moos-ivp-uidaho project.





#===========================
# Environment variables
#===========================
The /bin directory in the moos-ivp-uidaho source tree should be added to your 
PATH environment variable to allow launching apps using pAntler.  Those using
the BASH or DASH shells can do this by executing the following terminal command 
from within the moos-ivp-uidaho source tree:

    #> echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/bin' >> ~/.bashrc

This command need only be executed once, since it causes the moos-ivp-uidaho 
binary path to be registered for all subsequent terminal sessions.
